392 atoms: configuration with diazanediide formed + F-center (visible with a QE computation, use the scripts in the 'QE_analysis' subfolder in this repository). 

390 atoms: remove one N and one H atoms from the above configuration, to avoid the recombination of the F-center. 
This leads to an amide + an F-center, which is a good configuration to start the H- production reaction
