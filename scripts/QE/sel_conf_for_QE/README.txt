Scripts in this folder implement different ways to select LAMMPS configurations. They all use the parameters specified in 'params.py', which then needs to be edited before running the script.
'template_Li2NH_NH2.in' contains a prototype of the file(s) generated by these scripts, to be passed to QE for calculations. Usually, only the first part of the template file is copied into all the single files for scf, while the atomic coordinates differ from frame to frame.
The choice of the sigma thresholds happens by hand by looking at the errors distribution of the available configurations, through the script 'plot_err_and_thres.py'.

1) 'sel_conf_devi1.py' selects configurations based on the max_devi_f value in 'model_devi.out', using a single dump.xyz file (preferred option)
2) 'sel_conf_devi_many.py' does the same but any frame has its dump.*.xyz

In case one needs to take into account also the values of a Collective Variable (CV), the utility 'format_COLVAR.py' is provided. This script creates a unique COLVAR_ALL file from 2 or more COLVAR files, using also a unique time coordinate.
In this case, we have two options:
1)'sel_conf_COLVAR_and_devi.py', which does a pre-screening on configurations based on their deviations, and only afterwards filters them based upon the CV value (preferred)
2)'sel_conf_COLVAR.py', which selects configs only based on the CV values

Generally, these scripts require a few command-line parameters; in case one specifies a wrong number of parameters, the execution breaks up and an explanatory warning message appears.
